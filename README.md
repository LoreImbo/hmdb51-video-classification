# VIDEO CLASSIFICATION ON HMDB51 DATASET: HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION



GOAL: Develope a classification algorithm (LRCN) that exploits the main deep learning techniques in order to predict and recognize the simplest human actions.


## DATASET
The selected dataset is named 'HMDB - Human Emotion DB'. Each observation corresponds to one video, for a total of 6849 clips. Each video has associated one of 51 possible classes, each of which identifies a specific human behavior. Moreover the classes of actions can be grouped into: 1) general facial actions such as smiling or laughing; 2) facial actions with object manipulation such as smoking; 3) general body movements such as running; 4) body movements withi object interaction such as golfing; 5) body movements for human interaction such as kissing. 

Due to computational problems we have chosen only 19 classes (general body movements) on which to train the human activity recognition algorithm.
